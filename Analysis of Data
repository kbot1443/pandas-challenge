By far Charter type schools have a much higher passing rate than district schools. Charter schools have over 90% student pass rate in terms of math and reading whereas district schools have just over 50% pass rate. Large schools have a much lower overall pass rate with just over 50% pass rate vs small schools and medium schools with around 90~% pass rate. 
This suggests students attending  charter schools that are small/medium sized (0-3000 student population) will have a much higher chance of passing their math and reading exams to move on from highschool successfully. 
Another note is that if the lower the per capita costs a school spends on each student is less than $585 they will have a much higher chance of passing their math and reading exams to successfully pass highschool. This may be due to the school size/poppulation being small or medium. Larger schools receive more per capita than smaller schools however this do not lead to higher test scores in math and reading. 
In conclusion the most striking note is that larger schools tend to have much lower passing rates compared to small and medium schools. Reasons such as staff shortages, lack of facilties/resources such as books, funding, public safety and many more could be affecting larger schools vs smaller schools. More data is needed to understand the effects of why school a smaller sized school/student population correlates to higher passing rates in math and english.
